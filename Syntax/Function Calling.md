To call a function in GDLang you have to type it like this:

```

function_name;

```

But if there were parameters you would type it like this:

```

function_name param_1;

```

Here is an Example on how to call a function without parameters:

```

MyEpicFunction;

```

And How to call one with parameters:

```

MyEpicFunctionWithAnIntParameter 18;

```
